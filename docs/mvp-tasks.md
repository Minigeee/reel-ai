# MVP Tasks - Reel AI Mobile Video Upload & Display

## Overview
The initial MVP will focus on three core capabilities:
1. Selecting and uploading videos from mobile device
2. Storing videos in Supabase storage
3. Displaying a simple list of all published videos

## Task Sections

### 1. Database & Storage Setup
This section establishes the foundational data layer that other features will build upon.

Tasks:
1. [X] Create videos table in Supabase with basic fields:
   - id, user_id, title, description
   - video_url, thumbnail_url
   - created_at, updated_at
   - view_count

2. [X] Set up Supabase storage buckets:
   - videos/ - For video files
   - thumbnails/ - For video thumbnails

3. [X] Configure storage security policies:
   - Public read access for videos
   - Authenticated upload access
   - Size limits and file type restrictions

### 2. Video Selection & Upload
This section handles the mobile video selection and upload process.

Tasks:
1. [X] Create mobile-friendly video selection:
   - Native file picker integration
   - File type validation
   - Size limit checks

2. [X] Implement upload functionality:
   - Create upload progress indicator
   - Handle upload cancellation
   - Implement retry on failure
   - Generate and upload thumbnail

3. [X] Create upload state management:
   - Track upload progress
   - Handle upload errors
   - Manage concurrent uploads

### 3. Video List & Playback
This section focuses on displaying the uploaded videos.

Tasks:
1. [ ] Create video list query:
   - Set up React Query for videos
   - Implement basic pagination
   - Sort by recent first

2. [ ] Build video list UI:
   - Video card component
   - Thumbnail display
   - Basic video metadata
   - Loading states


3. [ ] Implement video playback:
   - Native video player integration
   - Basic playback controls
   - Handle playback errors
   - Loading states

### 4. Publishing Flow
This section connects the upload and display functionality.

Tasks:
1. [ ] Create video publishing form:
   - Title and description inputs
   - Basic validation
   - Submit handling

2. [ ] Implement publishing logic:
   - Save video metadata to database
   - Update video status
   - Handle publishing errors

3. [ ] Add success/error feedback:
   - Success notifications
   - Error messages
   - Redirect after publish

## Implementation Order

1. Database & Storage Setup
   - This provides the foundation for all other features
   - Needed for both upload and display functionality

2. Video List & Playback
   - Allows testing of video delivery
   - Provides immediate value for testing

3. Video Selection & Upload
   - Core functionality for content creation
   - Builds on storage setup

4. Publishing Flow
   - Connects upload and display features
   - Completes the basic content creation loop

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered complete when:
- Users can select videos from their mobile device
- Videos successfully upload to Supabase storage
- Uploaded videos appear in the video list
- Videos can be played back on mobile devices
- Basic metadata (title, description) can be added
- The system handles errors gracefully

## Future Considerations
(Not part of MVP but noted for future planning)
- Video processing pipeline
- Enhanced metadata
- User profiles
- Mobile-specific optimizations
