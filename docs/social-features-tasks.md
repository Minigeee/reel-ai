# Social Features Implementation Tasks - Reel AI

## Overview
This document outlines the concrete implementation tasks for adding social features to Reel AI. The objectives are to enable:
- Minimal User Profile functionality (display & edit)
- Video Likes and UI integration
- Follower system for managing user connections
- A dedicated search interface with separate tabs for Videos (default) and Users

## Task Sections

### 1. User Profiles
These tasks cover building a minimal profile UI and integrating with the Supabase database.

**Tasks:**
1. [X] **Profile Data & UI**
   - Create a profile page that displays:
     - Username, display name, bio, and avatar (seeded using free online URLs).
   - Develop an edit form for profile updates with basic validation.
   - Wire up the form to update user data in the users table.
2. [X] **Authentication & Routing**
   - Ensure that the profile page is accessible only to authenticated users.
   - Integrate with the existing auth system (Supabase) to fetch user details.
3. [X] **State Management & Data Fetching**
   - Use React Query to fetch and cache the user profile data.
   - Handle loading and error states appropriately.
   - Update the global user state if using Zustand or a similar state management library.

### 2. Likes Feature
These tasks enable users to like or unlike videos while updating the related UI immediately.

**Tasks:**
1. [X] **Database Integration for Likes**
   - Implement database operations for:
     - Inserting new likes into the `video_likes` table.
     - Deleting likes from the `video_likes` table.
   - Ensure proper error handling for unique constraint violations.
2. [X] **Like Button Component**
   - Create a reusable Like Button component to be placed on video detail pages.
   - Display both the like count (sourced from the Videos table) and whether the current user has liked the video.
   - Integrate React Query to perform optimistic updates when the like state changes.

### 3. Follower System
These tasks add the functionality for users to follow and unfollow other users.

**Tasks:**
1. [X] **Database Operations for Following/Unfollowing**
   - Implement database methods to:
     - Insert new follow relationships into the `follows` table.
     - Delete follow relationships from the `follows` table.
   - Validate requests to prevent duplicate entries.
2. [X] **Follow/Unfollow Button Component**
   - Build a Follow/Unfollow button component for user profile pages.
   - Update the component's state based on whether the current user follows the profile.
   - Use React Query for optimistic updates, ensuring a seamless user experience.
3. [X] **Display Follower Counts**
   - Update the profile UI to show follower and following counts.
   - Query these counts from the database and cache them. Ensure they update dynamically after follow actions.

### 4. Search Functionality for Social Features
Implement a search interface that allows users to discover videos and other user profiles.

**Tasks:**
1. [X] **Search Database Integration**
   - Implement database queries for:
     - Videos (search by title, description, filter by category and tags).
     - Users (search by username, display name, and bio).
   - Implement pagination and debouncing to optimize database queries.
2. [X] **Search UI with Tabs**
   - Design a mobile-friendly search interface that includes:
     - A default **Videos** tab displaying video results.
     - A **Users** tab for showing user profiles.
   - Build a single search input component that applies debouncing to reduce rapid database queries.
3. [X] **Results Display & Error Handling**
   - Render search results with clear loading indicators and error messages.
   - Ensure consistent styling across both tabs using Tailwind CSS.
   - Integrate React Query to manage asynchronous data fetching and caching.

## Implementation Order
1. **User Profiles:**  
   - Establish data fetching and minimal UI components for profile viewing and editing.
2. **Likes Feature:**  
   - Implement database operations and the Like Button component for video details.
3. **Follower System:**  
   - Develop the follow/unfollow database operations and corresponding UI elements.
4. **Search Functionality:**  
   - Build the search interface with two tabs and integrate with database queries.

## Success Criteria
The social features implementation will be considered complete when:
- Users can view and edit their profiles (with seeded avatar URLs).
- The Like button functions correctly with real-time UI updates.
- Users can follow and unfollow others, with updated follower counts.
- The search interface clearly displays results in separate tabs for videos and users, complete with loading, error, and pagination support.
