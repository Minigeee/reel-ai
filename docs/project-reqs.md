Week 1: Rapid Development (Due February 7 by 6 PM CST)
Your first week focuses on building a streamlined version of TikTok using AI development tools. Choose one user type and build a complete experience for them.


Choose Your Primary User
Content Creator: Users who make and share videos
Content Consumer: Users who discover and engage with content


Specify Your Niche
Narrow your focus to a specific type of user within your chosen category:
Creator Examples:
Fitness Coach sharing workout routines
Chef demonstrating recipes
Educator teaching concepts
Musician sharing performances
Beauty expert creating tutorials
Consumer Examples:
Fitness enthusiast looking for workouts
Home cook seeking new recipes
Student learning new topics
Music fan discovering new artists
Beauty enthusiast learning techniques


Define User Stories
Create detailed user stories for your specific user. For example:
Fitness Creator Stories:
"As a fitness coach, I want to add exercise timestamps to my workout videos"
"As a fitness coach, I want to tag videos with difficulty levels"
"As a fitness coach, I want to categorize videos by muscle group"
Recipe Consumer Stories:
"As a home cook, I want to save recipes by cuisine type"
"As a home cook, I want to filter videos by cooking time"
"As a home cook, I want to create collections of weeknight dinner ideas"


Build Vertically
Build complete features for your specific user type. Each feature should work end-to-end before moving to the next.
For example, if you choose Creator:
✅ Complete video upload → processing → publishing pipeline
❌ Partial implementation of comments, likes, AND sharing
If you choose Consumer:
✅ Complete video feed → view → interaction flow
❌ Partial implementation of profile, search, AND notifications
Remember: A fully functional app for one user type is more valuable than a partial implementation trying to serve both.


To pass week 1, you must:
Build and deploy a working vertical slice
Pick either creator or consumer
Pick a niche within your choice
Identify 6 user stories you are aiming to ship for the niche
Showcase your functionality in your video and code
Highlight your path, niche, and user stories in your walkthrough video
Show working functionality that matches the 6 user stories you picked earlier


Week 2: AI Innovation (Due February 14 by 6 PM CST)
Your second week focuses on enhancing your vertical slice with AI features that meaningfully improve the user experience.


Understand Features vs. User Stories 
An AI Feature is a major capability that solves a user problem. Each feature enables multiple User Stories - specific ways users interact with that feature to achieve their goals.
Choose Your AI Features Select 2 AI features that:
Address real problems for your chosen user type
Integrate naturally with your Week 1 implementation
Create significant value for your niche


Define User Stories 
Create at least 6 user stories across your chosen features. For example:
Creator Example:
Feature: SmartEdit
"As a creator, I can say 'remove awkward pause' and AI edits out silence"
"As a creator, I can say 'zoom on product' and AI adds zoom effects"
"As a creator, I can say 'enhance lighting' and AI adjusts dark scenes"
Feature: TrendLens
"As a creator, I get AI suggestions for optimal video length"
"As a creator, I receive trending hashtag recommendations"
Consumer Example:
Feature: SmartScan
"As a recipe learner, I can ask 'show sauce-making part' and jump there"
"As a recipe learner, I can search for specific techniques shown"
"As a recipe learner, I can find moments where ingredients are listed"
Feature: PersonalLens
"As a recipe learner, I get recommendations based on my skill level"
"As a recipe learner, I see content matched to my learning pace"


Build Vertically
Build complete features for your specific user type. Each feature should work end-to-end before moving to the next.


To pass Week 2, you must:
Implement 2 substantial AI Features
Define at least 6 User Stories across your features
Show working functionality that matches these user stories in your video
